# Dog-Breed-Identification
In this Project We have Build a Dog Breed identification model using Transfer Learning using Resnet50 model

Project Overview: the main purpose of our Project of is to identify breed of a dog if a photo of a dog is given

Dataset :You can see the dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

We have implemented this project using Convolutional Neural Network in which we have trained our model using Resnet-50 with technique called transfer learning.
